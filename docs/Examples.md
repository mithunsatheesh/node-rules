The example below shows how to use the rule engine to apply a sample rule on a specific fact. Rules fed into the rule engine may be as Array of rules or as individual rule objects.
	
``` js
//import the package
import RuleEngine from 'node-rules';

//define the rules
const rules = [{
	"condition": (R, fact) => {
		R.when(fact && (fact.transactionTotal < 500));
	},
	"consequence": (R, fact) => {
		fact.result = false;
		R.stop();
	}
}];
/*as you can see above we removed the priority 
and on properties for this example as they are optional.*/ 

//sample fact to run the rules on	
let fact = {
    "userIP": "27.3.4.5",
    "name":"user4",
    "application":"MOB2",
    "userLoggedIn":true,
    "transactionTotal":400,
    "cardType":"Credit Card",
};

//initialize the rule engine
const R = new RuleEngine(rules);

//Now pass the fact on to the rule engine for results
R.execute(fact, (result) => { 

	if(result.result) 
		console.log("\n-----Payment Accepted----\n"); 
	else 
		console.log("\n-----Payment Rejected----\n");
	
});
```
